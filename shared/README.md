2025-08-30 Status: Not passing  sampling params to the best of n because its defined in the best_of_n search function in sal.

Currently samples are diverse because of temperature in sampling

Move sal in this repo
Pass sampling params to search function
Add way to install sal to orchestrator

SAL comes from: https://github.com/probabilistic-inference-scaling/probabilistic-inference-scaling
